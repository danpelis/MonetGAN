# MonetGAN
CycleGAN to imitate art by Claude Monet for https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/overview

The goal of this project is to build a CycleGAN model capable of translating regular photographs
to images in the style of the French painter Claude Monet. This follows the task presented by the
Kaggle Competition "Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself". The CycleGAN model was created following this [tutorial by Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cyclegan-tutorial-with-keras/). This project served as the final for my AAI 628 (Deep Learning) course.

The Jupyter notebook provides detailed explanations for the structure of the model and the purpose of each cell.
